b18/ubuntu-client-salt
==============

###Notes###
This is a repository that configures a standalone Salt-Minion (masterless) on Ubuntu for the purpose of system configuration and
packages that should be installed. I built this for myself in order to simplify the process of building or re-building Ubuntu
clients, but anyone is welcome to use it.
